KEY-FEATURES OF THE APPLICATION:
1) This Application is GUI based developed on Python 3.7+ 
2) Required: any Compiler of python and libraries like Tkinter and Matplotlib
3) This Data base has no limits on data-entries 
4) Data will be saved in form of .txt (more compatible)
5) The Graph Analysis ðŸ“ˆ is runtime analysis which makes it more user friendly
6) The Data Entries and Data is displayed dynamically.
7) Buttons AND Their Functions:
â€¢ Search:
  â–ª It Takes Name And returns their Stored Data
â€¢ Enter:
  â–ª This will add name and this won't be saved until Saved button is clicked.
  â–ª And mandatory requirements are Name CNIC Amount and Age fields.
â€¢ Load:
  â–ª The New window will be appeared asking to select the file to be loaded or u 
can just enter new entries without loading any file and save them!
â€¢ Save:
  â–ª Ask Where To save. :)
â€¢ Show:
  â–ª This works if Data Display have lost their previous Data for e.g.: on clicking 
Search button it will show data.
â€¢ Graph Analysis:
  â–ª It's a very COOL feature this will require Three Fields (Amount, Present 
    Year, How many Year (like: 2,3,4,10-year plan))
â–ª It will show you data analysis with help of graph (Matplotlib).
â€¢ RUN Time Error Detections:
  â–ª Detects errors dynamically and shows bottom the graph button
â€¢ Exit:
  â–ª It will Exit the window and kill all operations
â€¢ Delete Selected:
â–ª It Will Delete Selected Items List Box Frame.3

GRAPHICAL DATAðŸ“Š:

Functions used:
â€¢ Placing Graphs:
  o Shows Bar Graphs and can be line a graph by changing plt.bar to plt.line
â€¢ Insurance Analysis:
  o This profit-based system multiplies for 12 months of 10% and can be redo line103 
y = amount * 0.1 * 12

For DevelopersðŸ’»:
Back-End Functions

There is total 9 functions called at various places
1. delete_it
2. save_file
3. Show
4. Search
5. append_data
6. load_file
7. insurance_analysis
8. placing_graph
9. button_graph
The Data is saved as after every entry there is Seperator â€˜,â€™ which separate the data of 
individual person data and each person's data is saved in next line.
The load_file function read data in â€˜,â€™ format convert it into list 2-d and show them in list box 
display. save_file will fetch all the data from the list box and Save them into .txt file the list 
box return data in form of tuples but is converted into list and save in .txt in required formats.

Drawbacks:
â€¢ Shows Graph but year and planned years are not saved because time shortage can be done on need-base.
â€¢ Amount should contain only integer not alphabets otherwise graph will not be shown.
â€¢ Data is saved in organized form donâ€™t misplace any data in .txt file
â€¢ File should be in .txt format
